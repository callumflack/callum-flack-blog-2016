Hi screen, this blog is vague. [It's not for SEO.](http://wazayak.com/archives/203) It's not about progressing my "career". In fact, I don't know what this blog is and [I don't really know what I'm doing](https://codon.com/i-have-no-idea-what-im-doing). Like my naturopath said (yes, I see one and I'm surprised as you, but I must be lucky because [this one is excellent](http://www.healthnaturally.com.au/)), my iridology shows I tend to follow tangents, burn into nervous energy easily and have trouble choosing what to do from the too many options I give myself. There are minute strains of Seth Godin running through my nerve endings urging me to "work in public". Yet I have seen the fascinating history of Venkat Rao's [Ribbonfarm](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/) since it began while I have not published a word (not to say I'm anything like Mr. Rao).

So I almost canned this thing, better things to do and all.

My biggest design inspiration in the past half decade has been gov.uk's [Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles). Look at that typography! Look at the information hierarchy. Beautiful. And so damn useful; it's my go-to digital product design shortcourse. And yes, being a collector-type, I can spot that same [Margaret Calvert font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_(typeface)#/media/File:Road.sign.arp.750pix.jpg) here on the warning signs along the Cairns beaches. Alongside gov.uk perusals sit the webblogs of [Ben Terrett](http://noisydecentgraphics.typepad.com/) and Russell Davies and genmon's [Interconnected](http://interconnected.org/home/) from which I've been silently feeding for years.

Let me get to the point. [This morning's post by Mr. Davies](http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2016/10/amateurs-and-experts.html) contained this:

> "I much prefer reading amateur writers writing about the field in which they're experts, rather than expert writers writing about fields in which they're amateurs."

Which was a comment from a post titled ["Reading and writing for our peers".](https://blog.jonudell.net/2016/10/23/reading-and-writing-for-our-peers/) by Jon Udell.

It's a comment I very much agree with. Just as I've found the most interesting music is mostly by unknown, so-called "amateurs", like the Black American Soul discs [that drive me nuts](https://sites.google.com/site/coloronetear/), or that most Victorian-era scientific breakthroughs were made by amateur Clergymen.

So, thank you Mr. Davies and Mr. Udell. And thank you to all those bloggers I keep reading. Here's to being ignorant, refusing SEO optimisation, self-publishing on Jekyll and finding peers. Or at least a mirror.
