Here's a picture from my phone of the National Australia Bank letting me know that my recent trample into their customer service desk to vent my frustration was now a closed case.

Firstly, it wasn't closed because there was no resolution. Secondly, I bet they class this one-way SMS as 'customer engagement'. And I love how it comes from 'NABNoReply' because it now looks like their slogan.

Then I got this [Gerry McGovern post](http://gerrymcgovern.com/new-thinking/when-communicator-met-customer) in my email:

> Communicator: Thank you for your feedback. We always strive to listen to our customers and respond to your needs.<br>Customer: No you don’t.

So then, of course, I [posted my picture on twitter](https://twitter.com/patternworks_/status/777827154381778944) along with Gerry's post link and got a NAB rep (or bot?) in reply. Did I feel like re-explaining the three month case history from scratch with yet another rep? No.

As a designer, this makes me think that 1) 'user experience design' is mostly about deeply understanding a task, then designing agency (such as a digital interface) that enables the task's completion quickly and repeatably, and 2) that 'customer service' has inherently the same goals.

So rather than nice branding, and timely-but-inconsequential [engagement](http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2015/08/you-cant-fix-a-service-with-engagement.html), I think NAB—and service organisations of the like—should build services that just work. The marketing will eventually be the product.

I have no doubt that building a service that works, and works for all customers, is very difficult. Far more difficult than my Dad realises. But as a customer, nobody cares. Unless it works.

When the [fintech](https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2016/06/14/-the-fintech-bu.html) finally comes along that makes it too easy for people to leave, everyone will.
