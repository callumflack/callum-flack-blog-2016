Today I received an email from NAB:

> We've learnt that whilst money's important, it's not what matters most. And that's because life is about more than money. It's about experiences, the connections we share and the relationships we build.

Another one-sided conversation. And I'm not hiring the NAB for life coaching. I just want control of my money. Because double-entry bookkeeping. Because what gets measured gets managed. Don't take my money then re-market to me, build me a better service.
