Attempting to remember the exact name of one of my wife's non-close friends, I realised I was having image associations for certain names. I thought the friend's name was something like 'Bertrand', and this image came to mind:

<figure class="Post-image Post-image--small">
	<img
		src="/assets/images/SlicedBeetroots.jpg"
		alt="Sliced Beetroots" />
</figure>

Sliced beetroots like you'd find in a can of beetroots. Like the word 'Bertrand', it's soft on the edges but flexibly holds it's shape.

I clarified the friend's name with my wife, and it turned out to be 'Beatrice'. So this image came to mind:

<figure class="Post-image Post-image--small">
	<img
		src="/assets/images/PurpleSpringOnions.jpg"
		alt="Purple spring onions" />
</figure>

Purple spring onions. The 'trice' in 'Beatrice' is just like the taste of onion: sharp, fresh and white. Yet the image I had was a purple spring onion. Perhaps 'Be' is purple.

I recognised this symbol habit I've had for a long time—since childhood I'm very sure—but it's not come into consciousness for a while. Perhaps it was a way to learn and remember the names of things, although today's episode felt like a pure language-image association. It's not synaesthesia. Can anyone tell me more about what this kind of sensation is?
