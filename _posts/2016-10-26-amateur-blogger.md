Hi Screen, this blog is vague. [It's not for SEO.](http://wazayak.com/archives/203) It's not about progressing my "career". In fact, I don't know what this blog is and [I don't really know what I'm doing](https://codon.com/i-have-no-idea-what-im-doing). Last week my naturopath (yes, I'm as surprised as you, but I must be lucky because mine has made a difference) said she reckons I burn into nervous energy because I don't like slowing down. There are specks of Seth Godin running through my nerve endings urging me to "work in public". Yet I have seen the fascinating history of Venkat Rao's [Ribbonfarm](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/) since it began while I have not published a word (not to say I'm anything like Mr. Rao).

So I almost canned this thing, better things to do and all.

And while doing better things, I keep reading along the way. Mostly online. For example, my favourite design inspiration in the past half decade has been gov.uk's [Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles). As well as being the go-to digital product design manifesto (IMHO), look at that typography! Cleaner, simpler, bolder, beautiful. And yes, being a collector-type, I can spot that same [Margaret Calvert font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_(typeface)#/media/File:Road.sign.arp.750pix.jpg) here on the warning signs along these Cairns beaches. And so alongside these [GDS](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) blog perusals sit the webblogs of [Ben Terrett](http://noisydecentgraphics.typepad.com/) and Russell Davies and genmon's [Interconnected](http://interconnected.org/home/) from which I've been silently feeding for years. Online reading is a chain like this.

Let me get to the point. [This morning's post by Mr. Davies](http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2016/10/amateurs-and-experts.html) contained this:

> "I much prefer reading amateur writers writing about the field in which they're experts, rather than expert writers writing about fields in which they're amateurs."

Which was a comment from a post titled ["Reading and writing for our peers"](https://blog.jonudell.net/2016/10/23/reading-and-writing-for-our-peers/) by Jon Udell.

I agree. So I thought I'd sit here and tell you that, Screen. Just as I've found the most interesting music is mostly by unknown, so-called "amateurs", like the Black American Soul discs [that drive me nuts](https://sites.google.com/site/coloronetear/), I feel I'm compelled to keep doing this amateur thing, dear Screen.

So, thanks Mr. Davies and Mr. Udell, please keep posting. As for me, here's to being ignorant, taking the long way, refusing SEO optimisation, self-publishing with Jekyll, and finding peers. Or at least a mirror.
