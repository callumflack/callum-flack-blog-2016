I've practiced karatedo for almost two years, and I'm a Beginner. I've always been a sporting natural but when it came to martial arts, I had to accept that I was just plain clueless.

Co-ordinating just one move fluidly? Difficult. Co-ordinating both left and right sides of an action were doubly difficult. Remembering that action in the following lesson, difficult again. Combining that action with another in sequence, both sides, compound difficult. And then learn their Japanese names, and then understanding their applications from kata, all difficult. And that's just physical actions. We're not even talking right effort, right mind yet.

Here is a video of mawashi-geri (roundhouse kick). We were practicing this kick the other night. I'd been working with uke—the person who "receives" a technique, that is, the training partner—for about five minutes, my kicking leg pulled up and out like a wing, high and round, then snapping out to and back from the body of uke. It was, as usual, difficult, and I was stuffed.

Sensei—literally "person born before another"—walked over and said "great, and now you should try to relax". We both paused, breathing heavily. "Here's a quick story" he continued, "not exactly a Japanese way of explaining it, more a Cairns way".

> Start with a shit kick. Then polish it on the next go. This way you're not trying so hard, which means you're not tense. Tension makes everything slower.

That hit me. Because I have perfectionist tendencies—for better and worse—I tend to try too hard.

I'm pretty sure you can apply the Shit Kick quip to most kinds of practice, and come out better for it. Action. Check. Action better. In software terms, this is the "shipping beats perfection" mantra. In human terms, this is the Samuel Beckett quote.

Perfect needs unperfect first.
