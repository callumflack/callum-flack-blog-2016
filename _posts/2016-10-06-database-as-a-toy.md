We've been using [You Need A Budget](https://twitter.com/ynab) since January in an effort to understand how our money flows. Yeah, what gets measured gets managed. I really admire the way YNAB have fostered a community by providing [money management education](https://www.youneedabudget.com/learn). What has become a drag with YNAB is it's insistence on complete reconciliation. Yeah, it should and I should. But I'm running around like a loon and I just never get to it and then the longer I leave it, the more red hot pain the upkeep is. I need a solid, just-in-time picture of my finances that I can run with, not a perfect painting.

I've also been researching ways of showing [my clients](http://www.patternworks.com.au/work/) efficient methods of using data to provide better online services. Rather than get into the full MEAN (or [MERN?](http://mern.io/)) stack just to get a working prototype, I've been testing tools with low entry points, like [Airtable](https://twitter.com/airtable?lang=en): a very user-friendly database as spreadsheet. I like how easy it is to call the API, and the GUIs for desktop and mobile are supernice. And you can relate one table to another. Plus file attachments, collaboration, app integrations, fun to use, etc.

I think it's killer feature is the one they started with: more flexible field types that are, at the same time, less error-prone.

Using it on my phone has been a pleasure, without being a reduced function set of the desktop app. And that means I've been able to very easily replicate YNAB on both mobile and desktop with Airtable.

Yes, if I go beyond 1200 records, I start paying more than I would with YNAB.

But think bigger. One now very easily and quickly test user data set flows (for text and images) on any device. And build out an interface using that data. For free.

I'm sure I could do that with another system. It's just that this gate was lower.

Now I find myself thinking about other ways I can use it. It's probably 5 or maybe 6 for me on Chris Dixon's scale of [life-changing inventions](https://medium.com/@cdixon/the-typical-path-of-how-people-respond-to-life-changing-inventions-3e250914bccd#.g4rde8f2h).
